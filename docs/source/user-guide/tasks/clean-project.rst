==================
Cleaning a project
==================

Your projects contain files that Anaconda Project creates 
automatically, such as any downloaded data and the 
``envs/default`` directory.

Use the ``clean`` command to remove such files and make a clean, 
reproducible project.

Run the following command from within the project directory::

  anaconda-project clean

Project removes automatically created files and downloaded data.

To restore these files:

* :doc:`Prepare the project <prepare-project>`.

  OR

* :doc:`Run the project <run-project>`.
