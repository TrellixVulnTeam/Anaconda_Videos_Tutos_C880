===================
Preparing a project
===================

When you run a project, Anaconda Project automatically 
generates certain files and downloads necessary data. The 
``prepare`` command allows you to initiate that process without 
running the project.

To prepare a project, run the ``prepare`` command from within 
your project directory::

  anaconda-project prepare
