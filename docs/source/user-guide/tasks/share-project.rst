Sharing a project
=================

To share a project with other people:

#. :doc:`Archive <create-project-archive>` the project.

#. Send the file to another user---for example, by email, by 
   copying the file to a shared network location, and so on.

   OR

   Upload the file to Anaconda Cloud by running the following 
   command from within the project directory::

     anaconda-project upload

   NOTE: You need a free Cloud account to upload projects to 
   Cloud.

#. The user retrieves the archive file and :doc:`runs the project 
   <run-project>`.
